### InfoSec Pat
Welcome to the InfoSec Pat channel. I love IT and showing people about technology. If you have anything to ask let me know. We also discuss different certifications and career paths. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me. I just want to have fun making videos and show people who are interested in IT that it is possible.

Join me and we will learn Information Security and more! I'm still learning myself but I like to share knowledge in an easily watchable fashion!

Please know that my videos are for educational purposes only. I do not encourage you to try them yourself on networks or computer systems as they may land you in trouble. Everything I demonstrate is demonstrated on things that I own myself in my lab.
